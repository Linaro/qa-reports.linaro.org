i'm trying to import production database into testing database so we can do some stress testing

I tried exporting it to S3, but the postgres engine it's a tiny teensy bit older than the version that supports exporting to S3 =(
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ExportSnapshot.html

An idea to try out
create a new db with 9.6.12 and restore from a db snapshot from production then export this restored db into S3

take a look at index public.core_test_name_3fd93ba6

k8s:
* changing a deployment file and applying it won't update pods
* make configmap/secret changes restart pods

Stress test
* delete 1 thousand testruns from lkft, android-lkft, lite among others
* set testjob.fetched = False on all the jobs of testruns
* next poll window will add thousands of tasks to the queue
* while that, keep accessing api and UI
  * fetch all tests
  * compare projects
  * access metrics page
  * more ideas?

Update staging
* ssh into Nat instance (have ci.linaro.org public key in authorized_keys)
  * run kubectl from it
  * it'll have a kubeconfig specifically for updading deployment in qareports-staging namespace
  * will have to create a service account in the k8s cluster named qareports-staging-ci-bot
  * associate this with a IAM role
  * assign that role to an instance profile and attach it to the NAT instance
  * hope this works, will try when i get back
